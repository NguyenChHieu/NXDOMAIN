# NXDOMAIN
NXDOMAIN is a group of 4 small programs that I've created to test with network-related knowledge during my first Uni year.
Consists of: A simple TCP-like server (server.py), a resolver (recursor.py) , a verifier (verifier.py) validates the equivalency of configurations.
and a launcher (launcher.py) which generates DNS server configurations.

An IP address is given to some device on the Internet, and that address is necessary to find the
appropriate Internet device - like a street address is used to find a particular home. **Analogously, a
port can identify a simplified DNS server in these programs**
